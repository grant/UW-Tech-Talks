Attention for your idea
How to launch a company
---

1st: Have a good idea
2nd: Have a small group of people who are passionate about your project
3rd: Be thrilled about the product
4th: Don't wait when you have a good idea.
5th: People want/lust is a lot more important than what people are build
6th: A business must touch one of the 7 deadly sins
7th: BE SEXY
8th: Sexiest job on the market is an entrepreneur, be evangelical. Nothing to lose, don't hold back.
9th: Sell yourself as someone worth knowing, who you can trust.
10th: Be real as a MOFO (Be honest in the corporate world)
11th: Split equity a lot. If you lose you feel smuck or feel king. 5% of smuck is worse than 5% king.
12th: Good opportunities can come out of social good

How you pitch:
-Imagine a headline you would want to read.

How to email a journalist:
-Good subject line
-Be incredibly short
-1st year compare to something else (Yahoo for entrerprise) (e-commerse for real estate)
-Take something known, add a twist and explain in one line.
-I'm going to be in your area soon.
-Let me buy you a cup of coffee (because they no office or they have a shitty office, they want to meet you in a coffeeshop)

I know what other people don't
-find a trend and learn about it

LEARN SEO (Because Google rules the world)

Have something on the web that nobody else has.
Create content and then have people link to it.
The field moves super fast (everything changes in 6 months)

VIRALITY

You need a viral coefficient more than 1 to go viral.
A product you cannot use without other people using it.
Have your friends install the app before you can use it.
Make people want to tell their friends

Solve people's problems offline. Don't rely on your own product's social network.
